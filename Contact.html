    <h1>Feedback time!!!!!!!!</h1>
    <p>This was my first ever attempt at a website using html. I added all the html techniques I have learnt to the website. Soon I will learn CSS (which deals with website design) and Javascript (which handles the website's behaviour/what it's supposed to do). I will make new sites with those incorporated soon. Please tell me what you thought of this 1996 style website using the form below (another new techniques I learnt.) This form may be too much of a hassle (it redirects you to email), so just message me ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚</p>

    <form action="mailto:aradh4na@gmail.com" method="post" enctype="text/plain">
      <label>Your Name:</label>
      <input type="text" name="YourName" value="">
<br>
      <label>Opinions??</label> <br>
      <textarea name="Opinions" rows="10" cols="30"></textarea>

      <input type="submit" name="">
    </form>
